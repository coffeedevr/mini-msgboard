This project is a forum site I made using Express. It uses Jade as its view engine and MongoDB as database via Mongoose. It features basic authentication via Passport.js and CRUD operations.

## What does this app do?
It is basically a generic forum site where people can login, post a thread and have a discussion.

## Why did I made this project?
This project started as a small message board as a part of the Odin Project Curriculum, but I went a little bit ambitious and made a schema for a thread model and a POST function to create new threads so it became a forum now.
I made this project to practice on my express and nodejs skills, along with db integration. 

## What improvements can you still make in this project?
* Blog API for site announcements.
* Delete and Update message and threads for users.
* User Profile management
* Hashed passwords for user accounts.
* Responsive on smaller screens.
